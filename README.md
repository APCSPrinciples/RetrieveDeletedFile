# Use a Hex Editor to retrieve a deleted file
For this lab you will need a thumb drive and computer with the HxD program. If you don't have a thumb drive, ask your instructor to borrow one. You may work with a partner. 
 
Steps to complete the lab:
-------------------------
1. Use a program like Notepad, Word Pad, LibreOffice or Microsoft Word to create a Plain Text (.txt) document. You can type anything you like, but you should use at least one distinctive or unusual word.
2. Save your Plain Text file to the thumb drive
3. Use File Explorer to delete the file from the thumb drive. One way is to right click on the file and choose delete
4. Open the HxD program
5. Choose *Extras | Open disk*, select your thumb drive and click *OK*
6. Search for the distinctive word. HxD will find the deleted file.
7. Close HxD, empty the trash and then repeat steps 5 & 6. HxD should still find the file
8. Show your instructor the deleted file

If you have extra time, use HxD to open other files on the computer and explore their data
